# CI for Release Branches Workflow Documentation

## Overview

The `ci-for-release.yml` workflow is tailored to support release branches in our GitHub repository, focusing on extensive testing, versioning, and preparation for deployment.

## Workflow Description

This workflow is triggered by any push to branches that match the `release/**` pattern. It consists of several jobs, each designed to simulate typical CI tasks crucial for preparing and finalizing versions for deployment.

### Jobs

1. **automation_hello**
   - **Trigger**: Runs on every push to `release/**` branches.
   - **Purpose**: Provides initial visibility and traceability by outputting basic information about the workflow and repository, such as workflow name, repository, branch, event name, and commit hash.

2. **dummy_build**
   - **Trigger**: Sequentially follows the `automation_hello` job.
   - **Purpose**: Simulates the build process for release branches, representing where actual build processes would occur.

3. **dummy_test**
   - **Trigger**: Follows the `dummy_build` job.
   - **Purpose**: Mimics the testing procedures, crucial for ensuring that releases are thoroughly tested before deployment. Outputs a message indicating simulation of testing procedures.

4. **dummy_code_quality_check**
   - **Trigger**: Occurs after the `dummy_test` job.
   - **Purpose**: Simulates code quality checks to ensure that releases meet the code standards. Outputs a message representing the simulation of code quality assessments.

## Best Practices and Usage

This workflow is particularly useful for:
- **Ensuring Release Stability**: By simulating testing and code quality checks, this workflow helps ensure that releases are stable and reliable before deployment to production environments.
- **Versioning and Tagging**: Release branches often involve versioning and tagging steps, which can be integrated into this workflow to automate versioning processes.
- **Documentation and Training**: Provides a clear example of CI processes for release branches, aiding in training and documentation efforts.

## Conclusion

The `ci-for-release.yml` workflow streamlines the preparation and finalization process for release branches, ensuring that versions are thoroughly tested and validated before deployment to production environments.
