# CI for Develop Branch Workflow Documentation

## Overview

The `ci-for-develop.yml` workflow is designed to support the development process on the `develop` branch of our repository. This workflow is pivotal in maintaining the stability and health of the `develop` branch, ensuring that all changes are thoroughly tested and reviewed before they are considered for release.

## Workflow Description

The workflow consists of several jobs, each tailored to handle different aspects of the development and integration process:

### Jobs

1. **develop_workflow**
   - **Trigger**: This job runs on every push to the `develop` branch.
   - **Purpose**: Outputs basic information about the workflow and the repository, such as the workflow name, repository details, branch triggered on, the event name, and the commit hash. This job aids in transparency and traceability of development actions.

2. **pull_request_job**
   - **Trigger**: Runs on every pull request to `develop`, excluding pull requests that are being closed.
   - **Purpose**: Performs checks to ensure that the pull request is ready for review, including basic validations and preliminary automated tests.

3. **pull_request_accepted**
   - **Trigger**: Activates when a pull request to `develop` is closed and successfully merged.
   - **Purpose**: Handles post-merge activities, potentially triggering further actions such as cleanup, notifications, or subsequent automated jobs like deployments or additional testing phases.

4. **pull_request_declined**
   - **Trigger**: Executes when a pull request to `develop` is closed without merging.
   - **Purpose**: Manages cleanup and logs activities for auditing purposes, ensuring resources are not wasted and providing a record of why certain changes were not accepted.

## Branch Protection Rules for `develop`

To protect the integrity of the `develop` branch and ensure that it remains stable and secure, the following branch protection rules are recommended:

1. **Require Pull Request Reviews Before Merging**
   - Enforces that all pull requests must be reviewed and approved by at least one designated reviewer before merging. This practice helps prevent the integration of unreviewed or potentially problematic code.

2. **Require Status Checks to Pass Before Merging**
   - Mandates that all status checks, including those set up in our GitHub Actions workflows, must pass before a pull request can be merged. This ensures that only code that meets all our quality and testing standards is integrated into `develop`.

3. **Require Linear History**
   - Maintains a linear commit history for easier tracking and reversion of changes if necessary.

4. **Include Administrators**
   - Applies all protection rules to administrators as well, to prevent bypassing of critical controls, even by users with elevated permissions.

5. **Restrict Who Can Push to the Branch**
   - Limits push access to specific roles or individuals, protecting the branch from accidental or unauthorized changes.

6. **Automate Security and Compliance Scans**
   - Incorporates automated scans for security vulnerabilities and compliance issues in pull requests before they are merged into `develop`.

These protection rules help ensure that every change made to the `develop` branch enhances the project without compromising its stability, security, or compliance with our development standards.
