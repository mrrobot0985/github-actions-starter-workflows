# CI for Main Branch (Production) Workflow Documentation

## Overview

The `ci-for-main.yml` workflow is tailored to support the main branch, also known as the production branch, in our GitHub repository. It focuses on rigorous testing and quality assurance to ensure the stability and reliability of the production-ready code.

## Workflow Description

This workflow is triggered by any push to or pull request targeting the `main` branch. It consists of several jobs, each designed to provide visibility into the workflow process and handle pull requests and their closures.

### Jobs

1. **automation_hello**
   - **Trigger**: Runs on every push to or pull request targeting the `main` branch.
   - **Purpose**: Provides initial visibility and traceability by outputting basic information about the workflow, repository, branch, event name, and commit hash.

2. **production_pull_request**
   - **Trigger**: Runs on every pull request targeting the `main` branch.
   - **Purpose**: Outputs details about the pull request, including its number, title, author, base branch, head branch, and merge commit.

3. **production_pull_request_closed**
   - **Trigger**: Runs when a pull request targeting the `main` branch is closed.
   - **Purpose**: Outputs details about the closed pull request, including its number, title, author, base branch, head branch, merge commit, and whether it was merged.

## Branch Protection

To ensure the stability and reliability of the main branch, we recommend applying the following branch protection rules:

- **Require pull request reviews before merging**: Enabling this rule ensures that changes to the main branch undergo code review before merging, maintaining code quality and reliability.
- **Require status checks to pass before merging**: Configure status checks, including CI checks, to ensure that all required checks pass before allowing merges into the main branch.
- **Restrict who can push to the branch**: Limit push access to specific individuals or teams to prevent accidental or unauthorized changes to the main branch.

## Best Practices and Usage

This workflow is particularly useful for:
- **Ensuring Production Stability**: By focusing on rigorous testing and quality assurance, this workflow ensures that the production-ready code in the main branch is stable and reliable.
- **Handling Pull Requests**: The workflow provides visibility into pull requests targeting the main branch, aiding in code review and collaboration.
- **Documentation and Compliance**: Provides clear documentation of CI processes for the main branch, aiding in compliance efforts and maintaining a reliable software system.

## Conclusion

The `ci-for-main.yml` workflow plays a crucial role in ensuring the stability and reliability of the production-ready code in the main branch, maintaining high quality and reliability in our software releases.
