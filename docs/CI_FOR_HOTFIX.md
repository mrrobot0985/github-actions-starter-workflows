# CI for Hotfix Branches Workflow Documentation

## Overview

The `ci-for-hotfix.yml` workflow is specifically designed to support hotfix branches in our GitHub repository, providing expedited testing and validation for critical production issues.

## Workflow Description

This workflow is triggered by any push to branches that match the `hotfix/**` pattern. It consists of several jobs, each designed to simulate typical CI tasks crucial for validating and deploying hotfixes.

### Jobs

1. **automation_hello**
   - **Trigger**: Runs on every push to `hotfix/**` branches.
   - **Purpose**: Provides initial visibility and traceability by outputting basic information about the workflow and repository, such as workflow name, repository, branch, event name, and commit hash.

2. **dummy_build**
   - **Trigger**: Sequentially follows the `automation_hello` job.
   - **Purpose**: Simulates the build process for hotfix branches, providing a placeholder for where actual build processes would occur.

3. **dummy_test**
   - **Trigger**: Follows the `dummy_build` job.
   - **Purpose**: Mimics the testing procedures, crucial for ensuring that hotfixes address critical issues without introducing new problems. It outputs a message indicating simulation of testing procedures.

4. **dummy_code_quality_check**
   - **Trigger**: Occurs after the `dummy_test` job.
   - **Purpose**: Simulates code quality checks to ensure that hotfixes meet the code standards. It outputs a message representing the simulation of code quality assessments.

## Best Practices and Usage

This workflow is particularly useful for:
- **Rapid Validation of Hotfixes**: Ensures that critical production issues are addressed and validated promptly before deployment.
- **Minimizing Risk in Production Deployments**: By simulating testing and code quality checks, this workflow helps minimize the risk of introducing new issues during hotfix deployments.
- **Documentation and Training**: Provides a clear example of CI processes for hotfix branches, aiding in training and documentation efforts.

## Conclusion

The `ci-for-hotfix.yml` workflow streamlines the validation process for hotfix branches, ensuring that critical issues are resolved and validated expediently before deployment to production environments.
